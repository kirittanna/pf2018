  ### Overview. A short introduction to the Processing software and projects
  from the community.


  For the past fourteen years, Processing has promoted software literacy,
  particularly within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology.
  Initially created to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach programming
  fundamentals within a visual context, Processing has also evolved into a
  development tool for professionals. The Processing software is free and open
  source, and runs on the Mac, Windows, and GNU/Linux platforms.


  Processing continues to be an alternative to proprietary software tools with
  restrictive and expensive licenses, making it accessible to schools and
  individual students. Its open source status encourages the community
  participation and collaboration that is vital to Processing’s growth.
  Contributors share programs, contribute code, and build libraries, tools, and
  modes to extend the possibilities of the software. The Processing community
  has written more than a hundred libraries to facilitate computer vision, data
  visualization, music composition, networking, 3D file exporting, and
  programming electronics.


  Processing is currently developed primarily in Boston (at Fathom Information
  Design), Los Angeles (at the UCLA Arts Software Studio), and New York City (at
  NYU’s ITP).


  #### Education


  From the beginning, Processing was designed as a first programming language.
  It was inspired by earlier languages like BASIC and Logo, as well as our
  experiences as students and teaching visual arts foundation curricula. The
  same elements taught in a beginning high school or university computer science
  class are taught through Processing, but with a different emphasis. Processing
  is geared toward creating visual, interactive media, so the first programs
  start with drawing. Students new to programming find it incredibly satisfying
  to make something appear on their screen within moments of using the software.
  This motivating curriculum has proved successful for leading design, art, and
  architecture students into programming and for engaging the wider student body
  in general computer science classes.


  Processing is used in classrooms worldwide, often in art schools and visual
  arts programs in universities, but it's also found frequently in high schools,
  computer science programs, and humanities curricula. Museums such as the
  Exploratorium in San Francisco use Processing to develop their exhibitions. In
  a National Science Foundation-sponsored survey, students in a college-level
  introductory computing course taught with Processing at Bryn Mawr College said
  they would be twice as likely to take another computer science class as the
  students in a class with a more traditional curriculum.


  The innovations in teaching through Processing have been adapted for the Khan
  Academy computer science tutorials, offered online for free. The tutorials
  begin with drawing, using most of the Processing functions for drawing. The
  Processing approach has also been applied to electronics through the Arduino
  and Wiring projects. Arduino uses a syntax inspired by that used with
  Processing, and continues to use a modified version of the Processing
  programming environment to make it easier for students to learn how to program
  robots and countless other electronics projects.


  #### Culture


  The Processing software is used by thousands of visual designers, artists, and
  architects to create their works. Projects created with Processing have been
  featured at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Victoria and Albert
  Museum in London, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, and many other
  prominent venues. Processing is used to create projected stage designs for
  dance and music performances; to generate images for music videos and film; to
  export images for posters, magazines, and books; and to create interactive
  installations in galleries, in museums, and on the street. Some prominent
  projects include the House of Cards video for Radiohead, the MIT Media Lab’s
  generative logo, and the Chronograph projected software mural for the Frank
  Gehry-designed New World Center in Miami. But the most important thing about
  Processing and culture is not high-profile results – it's how the software has
  engaged a new generation of visual artists to consider programming as an
  essential part of their creative practice.


  #### Research


  Software prototyping and data visualization are two of the most important
  areas for Processing developers. Research labs inside technology companies
  like Google and Intel have used Processing for prototyping new interfaces and
  services. Companies including General Electric, Nokia, and Yahoo! have used
  Processing to visualize their internal data. For example, the New York Times
  Company R&D Lab used Processing to visualize the way their news stories travel
  through social media. The NSF and NOAA supported research exploring
  phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity that was realized at the University of
  Washington as a dynamic ecology simulation. Researchers at the Texas Advanced
  Computer Center at UT Austin have used Processing to display large data
  visualizations across a grid of screens in the service of humanities research.


  #### Foundation


  The primary charge of the Foundation is to develop and distribute the
  Processing software. This includes the original Processing (Java), p5.js
  (Javascript), and Processing.py (Python). There is more information about the
  Foundation at

  #### History


  Processing was started by Ben Fry and Casey Reas in the spring of 2001, while
  both were graduate students at the MIT Media Lab within John Maeda's
  Aesthetics and Computation research group. Development continued in their free
  time while Casey pursued his artistic and teaching career and Ben pursued a
  Ph.D. and founded Fathom Information Design. Many of the ideas in Processing
  go back to Muriel Cooper's Visual Language Workshop, and it grew directly out
  of Maeda's Design By Numbers project, developed at the Media Lab and released
  in 1999. The Wiring and Arduino projects, in turn, grew out of Processing
  while Casey was teaching at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea in Italy.
  Processing also prompted John Resig (jQuery) to build Processing.js, a
  JavaScript version that then inspired more related work such as the Khan
  Academy curriculum in computer science. Versions of Processing that use
  Python, Ruby, ActionScript, and Scala are also in development. Processing and
  its sister projects have inspired over twenty educational books.
