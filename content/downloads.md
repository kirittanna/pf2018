  Earlier releases have been removed because we can only support the current
  versions of the software. To update old code, read the changes page. Changes
  for each release can be found in revisions.txt. If you have problems with the
  current release, please file a bug so that we can fix it. Older releases can
  also be built from the source. Read More about the releases and their
  numbering. To use [Android Mode](http://android.processing.org/), Processing 3
  or later is required.
